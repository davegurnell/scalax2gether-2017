We'll arrange a schedule on the day based on what peoples' interests.
We'll aim to have a mix of hacking and short talks/workshops.
This is a collection of ideas and proposals.

## Proposals for talks/workshops/round-tables

Ideas for talks, round-tables, workshops, and interactive sessions.
Anywhere from 10 to 60 minutes in length.
Sessions will be voted on unconference-style,
so some suggestions may not be taken up on the day.

### Heiko Seeberger, Whirlwind Tour of Akka Typed

One of the most wanted features for Akka has been type safety for actor messaging. 
With Akka Typed – which is still experimental – we finally can benefit 
from the help of the Scala (or Java) compiler. 
In this workshop we show the current state of Akka Typed using live demos and coding, 
covering core as well as cluster and persistence features. 
You should have solid knowledge of Scala and at least a basic understanding of Akka.

### Example Person, Example Workshop, about 30 minutes

http://example.com/link-to-external-material-if-applicable

A short description of the session format
(talk, hands-on workshop, round-table, etc)
and the topic of discussion.
Please keep descriptions short.
Feel free to link to extra information.
Let people know if they need laptops and
provide pointers to setup instructions if required.
